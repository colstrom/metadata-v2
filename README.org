#+TITLE: metadata-v2 - A Ruby Interface to the Joyent Metadata Protocol
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview
  
  ~metadata-v2~ provides protocol and socket abstractions to simplify
  interactions with any metadata service that conforms to Version 2 of the
  [[https://eng.joyent.com/mdata/protocol.html][Joyent Metadata Protocol Specification]].

  Included are drop-in replacements for the [[https://github.com/joyent/mdata-client/][mdata-client]] tools:
    - mdata-list
    - mdata-get
    - mdata-put
    - mdata-delete

* Why does this exist?

  The [[https://github.com/joyent/mdata-client/][mdata-client]] tools are both portable and well-documented. You should use
  them when available! ~metadata-v2~ only really becomes useful once you want to
  do non-trivial things with your metadata service.

* License

  ~metadata-v2~ is available under the [[https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license][MIT License]]. See ~LICENSE.txt~ for the
  full text.
